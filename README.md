# Automated Lineament Detection from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) & Field Pictures
# Background

In geological sciences, it is of major interest how faults and folds are oriented in nature, since they can host potentially hazardous earthquakes. In this design report, we discuss how the output of an automated lineament (faults) detection algorithm is statistically analyzed and what the potential benefits are, of having an automated algorithm adding automatism and subjectivity to the geologistâ€™s job. Additionally, the algorithm is also applied to field photographs (small scale), to test its performance for structure analysis as it is of particular interest for structural geologist.


The aim of this CAS project is multi-fold and wants to

a) Analyze the output (lineaments) from DEMs at various illumination angles

b) Analyze the output (lineaments) from FIPHs with various image enhancement techniques applied

c) Compare the results with data from hand-picked datasets

# Part 1: Analyse DEM and create lineaments (creating our dataset)
Colab python file reads in digital elevation model (DEM), and hillshade pictures from various angles
-> Files are all in Folder: DEM and Hillshade

# Part 2: Unsupervised ML for k-means clustering
Colab python code analysis the
