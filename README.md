# Automated Lineament Detection from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) & Field Pictures
# Background

In geological sciences, it is of major interest how faults and folds are oriented in nature, since they can host potentially hazardous earthquakes. In this design report, we discuss how the output of an automated lineament (faults) detection algorithm is statistically analyzed and what the potential benefits are, of having an automated algorithm adding automatism and subjectivity to the geologistâ€™s job. Additionally, the algorithm is also applied to field photographs (small scale), to test its performance for structure analysis as it is of particular interest for structural geologist.


The aim of this CAS project is multi-fold and wants to

a) Analyze the output (lineaments) from DEMs at various illumination angles

b) Analyze the output (lineaments) from FIPHs with various image enhancement techniques applied

c) Compare the results with data from hand-picked datasets

# Part 1: Analyse DEM and create lineaments (creating our dataset)
Colab python file reads in digital elevation model (DEM), and hillshade pictures from various angles

-> Files are all in Folder: DEM and Hillshade; code accesses automatically the files in github

Various filtering techniques are tested, and an edge detection algorithm (Canny) is applied for lineament detection.

Excute step by step. Final step allows to export the created Lineament to your google drive.

# Part 2: Unsupervised ML for k-means clustering
Colab python code loads lineaments created from Part 1.

loads data (lineaments from previous part, csv-files; directly loaded from github) into notebook and uses this data for furhter procecssing and analysis.

Checks for various correlation between different parameters of the dataset (length vs fault strike vs location etc.)

Code applies k-means to find clusters in dataset.

# Folders: Figures_Output Part 1 and 2
These folders contain all pictures created with the notebook from Part 1 and Part 2.
